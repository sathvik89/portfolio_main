          Hi, I'm Sathvik! a first-year Computer Science student at Newton
          School of Technology, Rhilood University, Sonipat. I love coding ,
          problem solving , exploring new technologies and just do something on
          laptops/screens. Over time, I've expertise in Python, HTML, CSS,
          JavaScript, and React library. Learning Data structures and algorithms
          . And I enjoy building projects that bring ideas to life. So far, I've
          completed quite a few projects that showcase my skills in web
          development and programming. I also love solving problems on platforms
          like LeetCode (210+ problems solved) and Codeforces (757+ rating)
          Academically, I've been doing well too, with an SGPA of 8.696 in my
          first semester . When I'm not coding or studying, you'll probably find
          me on the courtâ€”playing badminton, cricket, or lawn tennis . Sports
          keep me energized and active . As a part of Neutron 2.O i've also
          gained communication skills , teamworking skills , time management ,
          managing deadlines etc . I always try to give my best and learn along
          the way. I'm excited to keep growing as a developer and see where this
          journey takes me!
