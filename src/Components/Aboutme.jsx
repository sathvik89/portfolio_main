          Hi, I'm Sathvik! I'm a first-year Computer Science student at Newton
          School of Technology, Rhilood University, Hyderabad. I'm super
          passionate about coding and problem-solving, and I love exploring new
          technologies.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Over time, I've gained hands-on experience with Python, HTML, CSS,
          JavaScript, and React , and I enjoy building projects that bring ideas
          to life. So far, I've completed 3-4 mini-projects that showcase my
          skills in web development and programming. I also love solving
          problems on platforms like LeetCode (210+ problems solved) and
          Codeforces (757+ rating)
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Academically, I've been doing well too, with an SGPA of 8.696 in my
          first semester . But beyond academics, I believe in learning by doing
          and staying curious about how things work.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          When I'm not coding or studying, you'll probably find me on the
          courtâ€”playing badminton, cricket, or lawn tennis . Sports keep me
          energized and teach me the value of teamwork and perseverance.
          Speaking of teamwork, I recently helped organize Neutron Fest 2.0 at
          our college. It was such a rewarding experience, and it really
          highlighted my ability to manage tasks, collaborate with others, and
          meet deadlines.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          I'm all about time management and balancing my interests. Whether it's
          coding, organizing events, or playing sports, I always try to give my
          best and learn along the way. I'm excited to keep growing as a
          developer and see where this journey takes me!
